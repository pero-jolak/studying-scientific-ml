# A learning process of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)

In this repository I share my learning process of scientific machine learning.


## Partial differential equations (PDEs)

In order to build stronger understanding, for each PDE I do the following:

- Derive solution(s) to a particular PDE with a known method;
- Use a numerical algorithm (Finite difference or Finite element) to approximate the solution.
- Use a modern technique (Physics-informed Neural Networks or operator based method).

### Heat equation

Solving the heat equation:
- Analytically: [separation of variables](https://github.com/pero-jolak/studying-scientific-ml/blob/main/Partial%20differential%20equations%20(PDEs)/Heat%20equation/heat_eq_analytic.pdf) and Fourier transform.
- Numerically: Crank-Nicolson finite difference method.
- Physics-informed neural network.

### Laplace's equation

### Poisson's equation

### Wave equation

## Sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy)
