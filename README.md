# A learning process of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)

In this repository I share my learning process of scientific machine learning.

My first idea: in order to build stronger understanding, for each PDE I do the following:

- Derive solution(s) to a particular PDE with a known method (old school);
- Use a numerical algorithm (Finite difference or Finite element) to approximate the solution.
- Use modern technique (Physics-informed Neural Networks or operator based method).
